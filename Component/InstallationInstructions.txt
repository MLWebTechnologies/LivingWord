LivingWord 1.1

If this is an upgrade from an earlier version of LivingWord:

1. Install the LivingWord 1.1 component using the normal Joomla component install procedures.


2. Configure LivingWord using the LivingWord Admin component console.


3. For Email reminders to function, you must choose to either install and enable the included LivingWord mambot/plugin or to configure a Cron/ job on your webserver to run the included livingword.ext.php file.

a. The mambot/plugin will run once a day based on your site's traffic.  Works well with most websites.  Most times the search engine bots will trigger the LivingWord bot to send its reminders, usually after midnight.


b. The components/com_livingword/livingword.ext.php file provides the most flexibility of when to send the email reminders.  It takes more administration however to set up.  It can be launched from a Cron or Task scheduler at a time of your choosing and will run only once a day.
