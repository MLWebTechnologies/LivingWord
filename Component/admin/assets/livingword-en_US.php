define('INTROMSG','The Bible is the most remarkable collection ever written.<br />Over a period of two thousand years; in times of war and peace.  Written by kings, physicians, tax collectors, farmers, fishermen, singers, and shepherds.  Written in three languages - Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.  Such a diverse group of writers, yet this cohesive unity is inspired and perfected by the Holy Spirit Himself.  Jesus Christ is the grand subject, our good is its design, and the glory of God is its end.<br /><br />&quot;Breathing life into all who believe...The Word is alive!&quot;  (<small><a href=&quot;http://www.castingcrowns.com&quot; target=&qout;_new&quot;>Casting Crowns</a> - Word is Alive</small>)<br /><br /><i><small>&quot;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.&quot; <b><a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Tim+3:16-17;&version=51;&interface=print&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;>2 Tim. 3:16-17</a></small></i></b>');
